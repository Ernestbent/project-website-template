# Future Plans for Feature Enhancement
We aim to generate maximum revenue out of your health and fitness app, targetting Android and iOS is the right choice. You can develop native apps individually for Android and iOS, or we can go with a cross-platform app development approach. Choosing cross-platform reduces cost, speeds up the app development process, and delivers you an app that works flawlessly on both the platforms and multiple devices
